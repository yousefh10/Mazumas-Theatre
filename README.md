# Movie Theatre Ticket Reservation Application

Developed a ticket reservation system where registered and guest users can reserve tickets for movies. Users can search and select movies, pick a showtime, view available seats graphically, make payments and receive a confirmation of bookings by email. Unsatisfied with your booking, a user can also cancel their booking and receive a refund. Administrators can add/delete movies and users from the database.
